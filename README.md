# Treehouse-FEWD-Project-2 "Pagination"

Long lists don't make for a good user experience on a web page. In this project, we'll enhance the usability of a web page that contains a long list by employing JavaScript to dynamically divide the list into "pages". As a bonus challenge, we'll add a search feature to display only the students that match the search criteria. 

This project builds on my understanding of JavaScript.  This was also solved only using vanilla Js.
